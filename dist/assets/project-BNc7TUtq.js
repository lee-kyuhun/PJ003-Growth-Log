# Project Overview

The Kanban Manager is a productivity tool designed to help individuals and small teams organize their tasks visually. 

## Key Features
- **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive interface for moving tasks between columns.
- **Persistent Storage**: Saves data to local storage.
- **Customizable**: Add, rename, and delete columns.

## Technical Challenges
Implementing smooth drag-and-drop interactions while maintaining state consistency was the primary challenge. I utilized \`dnd-kit\` for its flexibility and accessibility features.
