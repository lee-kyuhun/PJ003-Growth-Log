# Project Overview

This project explores the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in collaborative problem solving.

## Key Features
- **Agent Roles**: Define specialized agents (Researcher, Writer, Reviewer).
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage task handoffs between agents.
- **Memory Management**: Shared context using vector databases.

## Learnings
Understanding the nuances of prompt engineering and context management was crucial for effective agent communication.
